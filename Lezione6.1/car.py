#9-9. Battery Upgrade: Use the final version of electric_car.py from this section. 
#Add a method to the Battery class called upgrade_battery(). 
#This method should check the battery size and set the capacity to 65 if it isnâ€™t already. 
#Make an electric car with a default battery size, call get_range() once, and then call get_range() a second time after upgrading the battery. 
#You should see an increase in the carâ€™s range.
